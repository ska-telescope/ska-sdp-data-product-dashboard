Documentation for the SKA Data Product Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SKA Data Product Dashboard `ska-dataproduct-dashboard` is a web-based application
that simplifies browsing and downloading data products stored within the persistent volume within a cluster.

It utilises the `Data Product API <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-dataproduct-api/en/latest/>`_ as the backend
to retrieve data products and their metadata. The repository mostly contains the frontend configurations to render
the webpage in a user-friendly manner.
